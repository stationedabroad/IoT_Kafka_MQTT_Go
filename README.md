# MQTT IoT example with Kafka, Avro and Golang ...

Using Confluent provided (thanks) kafka docker images, with a golang docker image on the same
network.  This uses a specified Avro Schema to read IoT data from an MQTT server using the owntracks
app.

MQTT data pushed to kafka topic using Golang, then consumed by elastic search with Kibana reporting.

More to come ...
